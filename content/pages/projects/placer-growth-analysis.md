## INFERENCES AND CONCLUSION

*   Prioritize Mobile Campaigns: The data shows that mobile devices generate the highest number of sessions and users, especially on platforms like Facebook and Aptus. Marketers should focus on optimizing ads for mobile users, ensuring responsive design and mobile-friendly content, as this segment shows the most engagement and potential conversions.

*   Optimize for High-Performance Campaigns: Campaigns like Facebook’s FBNU1770.1 and AptusDermicoolLTCDTP.NU1545.320x50 have shown high user engagement and session duration, particularly in May, June, and September. These should be prioritized, with increased budget allocation and continuous ad creative optimization to maximize ROI.

*   Leverage Desktop for Long Session Durations: Although mobile generates more traffic, desktop campaigns tend to have longer session durations, especially on Facebook and Aptus. This suggests that desktop users are more engaged once they interact. Marketers should maintain and optimize desktop ads to capitalize on this deep user engagement, focusing on content-rich ads for these users.

*   Focus on Peak Performance Months: Campaigns performed best during May, June, September, and October. Marketers should allocate larger portions of their ad budget during these months for key campaigns to maximize exposure and engagement. Off-peak months can be used for testing and experimenting with new strategies.

*   Review and Adjust Low-Engagement Campaigns: Platforms like GoodRx, MediaIQ, and Healthline have shown consistently low levels of engagement and session duration. Marketers should review the creative and targeting strategies for these platforms. If improvements don’t yield better results, budget reallocation to higher-performing campaigns would be wise.

*   Expand High-Engagement, Low-Traffic Platforms: Platforms like ParkinsonsNewsToday and RemedyHealth show high engagement per user but relatively lower traffic. Marketers should explore ways to increase impressions and clicks on these platforms while maintaining quality traffic and engagement.

*   Test Ad Formats and Sizes: Ad formats like the 320x50 and 300x250 mobile banners on Aptus have performed well in terms of engagement. Marketers should consider expanding their use of these formats, A/B testing creative elements, and maintaining focus on optimizing the best-performing formats across campaigns.

*   Implement Conversion Tracking: If not already in place, marketers should set up conversion tracking to correlate engagement metrics like impressions, sessions, and clicks with actual business outcomes. This would allow better insights into which campaigns drive the most valuable actions.

*   Reduce Spending on Underperforming Platforms: For platforms like GoodRx and Healthline, where engagement is low, marketers should consider reducing ad spend or completely removing these from the campaign strategy unless performance improves after optimizations.
