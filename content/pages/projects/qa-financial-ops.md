CONCLUSIONS

### 1. **Overall Complaint Statistics**

*   **Total Complaints**: 75,513 complaints logged between December 2011 and October 2020.

*   **Timely Response Rate**: An impressive **98.1%**, indicating strong responsiveness to customer issues.

*   **In Progress**: Only **283 complaints (0.37%)** remain unresolved, showcasing efficiency in addressing issues.

*   **Resolved at No Cost**: **84.5% of complaints** were resolved without additional cost to the consumer.

*   **Disputed Rate**: **9.8%** of complaints were disputed by customers, suggesting room for improvement in resolution satisfaction.

### 2. **Complaints by Issue**

*   **Top Issues**:

    *   "Managing an account" and "Deposits and withdrawals" are the most common issues.

    *   Other notable issues include "Trouble during the payment process" and "Struggling to pay mortgage."

*   Less frequent but still significant complaints involve **identity theft/fraud**, **interest rates**, and **getting a credit card.**

### 3. **Complaints by States**

*   Certain states, like **Georgia (GA)**, **Florida (FL)**, and **Texas (TX)**, have higher volumes of complaints, possibly due to larger populations or regional-specific financial challenges.

### 4. **Complaints by Media**

*   **Web** is the most common channel for complaints (**50.37%**, 38,036 complaints), reflecting a preference for digital interactions.

*   **Referrals** and **Phone** also account for significant portions, while traditional methods like **Postal Mail** and **Fax** are less used.

*   **Email** has the least usage, likely due to inefficient complaint tracking through this medium.

### 5. **Complaints by Product**

*   **Credit Card**-related issues lead with 19,176 complaints.

*   Other notable product categories include **Checking or Savings Accounts**, **Mortgages**, and **Credit Card Prepaid Accounts.**

*   Lower complaint volumes are seen in **Vehicle loans/leases** and **Student loans.**

### 6. **Consumer Dispute Rate**

*   **9.8% of consumers** actively disputed resolutions.

*   A large proportion of complaints (**41.3%**) have "Unknown" resolution status, indicating potential gaps in data capture or follow-ups.

### Opportunities for Improvement:

*   Address recurring issues in **managing accounts** and **deposit/withdrawal processes**.

*   Investigate states with high complaint volumes for localized solutions.

*   Review dispute cases to identify gaps in resolution satisfaction.

*   Enhance support channels with lower usage (e.g., email) for better tracking and accessibility.
