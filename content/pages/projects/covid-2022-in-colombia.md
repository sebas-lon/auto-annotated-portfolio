## INFERENCES AND CONCLUSION

In this dashboard, I’ve pulled together the main metrics we should keep an eye on to help us improve. The first one is Net Annual Recurring Revenue, which we get by adding new revenue and expansions from existing clients and then subtracting churn. I like to visualize this as a time series so we can see how it grows over time. Most SaaS businesses work like a funnel, so it’s important to track how many leads come in and how many turn into closed deals to optimize the process and boost our bottom line.

We can also calculate key metrics like CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) along with churn. A negative churn is significant for SaaS, as it means we’re generating more revenue from our existing customers, even if we have fewer of them.

Lastly, in terms of market culture, we can look at the SAM (Serviceable Available Market) and market share, which helps us see how much we can grow and how many reps we’ll need to get there. We can also keep track of the KPI for timely hiring to ensure we’re on track to hit our growth targets.
